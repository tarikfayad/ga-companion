## Roadmap
Unordered, but these are the features I'd currently like to support.
- [ ] Ability to delete Decks and Matches
- [ ] Fix a small UI quirk when one player has 3+ champs and the other has 1-2 (elements don't sit flush as they should)
- [ ] Saving full deck lists
- [ ] Importing decks from Silvie
- [ ] iCloud saving for matches and decks
